<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>There may be no one in Hollywood who won’t be mad at this list. (Sorry,
not sorry.) Arrived at from a distinctly unscientific consideration of
scale, influence, original programming quality, library strength, value,
user interface and more, our (far from exhaustive) guide to the paid
streaming services is sure to make those who bristle at power quail at the
top, and those who desire it blanch at the bottom.
<br>
<br>
In the increasingly cutthroat battle that we’ve come to call “the
streaming wars,” there are, no question, winners and losers — for now, if
not forever. At a moment of profound transition for the industry, during a
writers’ strike in which the power of platforms is a central issue,
understanding the streaming pecking order is not simply an attempt to help
readers comparison shop. It’s also an acknowledgment that power waxes and
wanes. The one thing it rarely stays is steady, at least not for long.</p>

<p>To crib from Rose Bowl broadcaster Keith Jackson, this one is the
granddaddy of them all. The onetime DVD rental company has become the most
popular, and most powerful, platform in the business, harnessing streaming
technology to create a global content empire. It can be credited, among
other achievements, with rewriting the history of the Oscars and Emmys,
earning hundreds of nominations and wins; popularizing non-English-
language television among U.S. audiences; and inspiring its more
established counterparts to enter the streaming wars themselves. The
company isn’t impervious — its back catalog has suffered from competitors
clawing back beloved programs like “Friends,” and its reputation has been
damaged by PR crises caused by Dave Chappelle’s transphobic comedy
specials and its key role in the writers’ strike — but Netflix remains the
gold standard. Since it entered the original-programming game with the
likes of “House of Cards” and “Orange Is the New Black” 10 years ago, it
can fairly be said to have reshaped the industry in its own image, for
better and for worse.</p>

<p>Take the name literally: Disney+ is much more than a streaming version of the Disney Channel. Though it includes the Mouse House’s familiar catalog of princes and princesses, heroes and villains, including a century’s worth of animated classics such as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,”
“Dumbo,” “Sleeping Beauty,” “Beauty and the Beast,” “The Lion King,”
“Frozen” and “Moana,” the service’s real power is that of Disney the
multinational conglomerate. Through its Marvel Studios shingle, Disney+ is
home to the most sprawling superhero franchise in history, now featuring a
suite of TV shows to accompany its feature films. Through Lucasfilm, it
features an expanding array of canonical “Star Wars” stories, such as “The
Mandalorian.” Through Pixar, it includes fully half of the Oscar winners
for animated feature since the award’s inception in 2001. With
“WandaVision” and “Andor,” it’s even begun to make inroads in the realm of
prestige drama, an area where it has had less of a footprint to date. It
may not have Netflix’s scale (yet), but Disney+ is the sum of constituent
parts with proven cultural staying power. Including, yes, nostalgic TV
shows from the Disney Channel, such as “Hannah Montana,” “Lizzie McGuire”
and “Boy Meets World.”</p>

<p>Max, rebranded in May as part of the ongoing integration of WarnerMedia
and Discovery Inc. into Warner Bros. Discovery, may not have HBO in its
name anymore, but HBO remains its most vital asset. Between its extensive
catalog of landmark HBO series (“The Sopranos,” “Sex and the City,” “The
Wire”) and the availability of some of the buzziest TV of the moment (“The
Last of Us,” “Succession,” “Hacks”), Max is, in essence, HBO for cord-
cutters. The rest, including a strong library of Warner Bros. studio
classics, DC Comics titles and, yes, Discovery offerings, is just gravy —
which makes the name change, whose results are still uncertain, something
of a risk. Watch this space.</p>

<p>Since breaking through with “Transparent” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”
Amazon Prime Video’s original programming track record has been spotty,
combining bona fide hits (“The Boys”), high-profile failures (“The
Romanoffs”) and a number of projects (“The Rings of Power,” “Citadel”)
that have attracted as much attention for their stratospheric production
costs as their quality. Perhaps that sort of scrutiny is inevitable for
the only streaming service attached to a retail behemoth — TV! With free
shipping! — but if Prime Video hasn’t yet enunciated as clear a brand
identity as competitors like Disney+, it remains part of an attractive
package deal. And though its user interface is clunky for those just
browsing for something to watch, it is an industry leader when it comes to
the ease and reach of its video-on-demand offerings. Prime also makes it
simple to add subscriptions to other streaming services, which makes it a
one-stop shop for culture vultures.</p>

<p>Paramount+ jumped up a few rungs on the power-rankings ladder with the
announcement of Paramount+ With Showtime, which launches June 27. Already
a sleeper hit with certain streaming buffs — fans of “Star Trek,” Robert
and Michelle King and early seasons of “The Real World,” for instance —
the combined platform can only benefit from the presence of water-cooler
shows like “Yellowjackets” and “Couples Therapy,” plus, this fall, a
“Yellowstone” sequel. Add to that the ability to livestream local CBS
stations, sporting events and awards shows like the Grammys and Tonys, and
Paramount+ With Showtime, despite the mouthful of a name, is a full-
service streamer at a highly competitive price point. Nearly a decade
after the launch of CBS All Access, this iteration of the platform will be
the best indication yet of whether the company can (finally) go toe to toe
with the competition.</p>

<p>Whether Hulu benefits from or has been saddled with its origins as a joint
venture among networks likely depends on who you ask — but there’s no
question that the streamer’s programming punches above its weight.
Combining sterling originals development (“The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Only
Murders in the Building”), the fruitful FX on Hulu partnership (“Mrs.
America,” “Reservation Dogs”), a series library that’s quietly among the
best in the business and a live-TV add-on, it certainly impresses relative
to its scale. (Its film offerings are not such a sure bet.) Perhaps most
advantageously, it’s a next-day streaming home for a number of the
broadcast networks’ most acclaimed shows, including Emmy winner “Abbott
Elementary.” That it isn’t more dominant might be the foremost strike
against it: It should be known more widely as the TV addict’s dream.
Instead, it’s a streaming perennial facing an uncertain corporate future.</p>

<p>Perhaps no new player in the streaming wars has been subject to as much
skepticism as Apple TV+ was when it launched in the fall of 2019 — but the
Silicon Valley mainstay has earned its stripes as a force in Hollywood
with a strong slate, led by global hit and Emmy darling “Ted Lasso” and
underdog Oscar winner “CODA.” By making Apple TV+ available free to device
buyers for a limited time, the company may guarantee itself a floor, but
whether it has attracted subscribers at scale is harder to know; of all
the streamers, Apple is tightest-lipped about the numbers. In the
meantime, it will benefit from building its library with more seasons of
“The Morning Show,” “For All Mankind” and “Pachinko.” After all, it can’t
rest on the laurels of historical hits — unless, like Amazon, it buys a
studio.</p>

nothing to sniff at: According to Nielsen, the platform attracts a greater
share of streaming users than any other single platform, including
Netflix. Still, though the site has made the aforementioned genres part of
Internet culture’s lingua franca, its short-lived foray into original
series left it with far fewer iconic titles than its competitors. Indeed,

<p>As is the case with making film and TV, limitations are not always a bad
thing. Though Starz’s footprint is admittedly smaller than that of Max or
Paramount+ With Showtime, there are advantages to a premium channel
without all the add-ons. Don’t discount the pleasures of a rotating grab-
bag of movies for those of us regularly paralyzed by endless options, or
the relief of seeing an original series slate that’s full but still
manageable. The value-for-money proposition remains best for fans of
“Outlander” — creeping up on its 100th episode — and “Power” — now on its
fourth franchise entry — but there is programming for a range of tastes,
from the strip club (“P-Valley”) to the royal French court (“The Serpent
Queen”), modern-day cater-waiters (“Party Down”) to ’70s pornographers
(“Minx,” picked up from HBO Max). Plus, through its #TakeTheLead program
of “transparency talks,” summits and industry partnerships, the network
continues to highlight stories from women, LGBTQ+ people and people of
color in a way subscribers can feel good about.</p>

<p>Unscripted reigns supreme on Discovery+, where the combined catalogs of
Animal Planet, CNN, Food Network, HGTV, History, ID, TLC and more form the
ultimate powerhouse for self-improvers and rubberneckers alike. Eager to
create a tasteful home with tips from Magnolia’s Chip and Joanna Gaines?
You got it. Want to unwind at the end of a hard day of reno with the
latest episode of “MILF Manor”? No need to sign into a different streamer.
What it (sorely) lacks in prestige, Discovery+ may make up for in sheer
influence, given the popularity of the titles collected there — and all at
a price that even the stars of “Extreme Couponing” could swallow. To quote
Ina Garten herself, how bad can that be?</p>

<p>Relatively (if not yet fatally) late to the streaming game, Peacock
inherited its proud bird logo and name from NBC’s “living color” icon when
it launched wide in July 2020, and boasts a vast library of content from
the NBC Universal family: Beloved sitcoms like “The Office” and “Parks and
Recreation,” Bravo reality franchises like “The Real Housewives,” news
channels MSNBC and CNBC and a dedicated Telemundo vertical. Now its
original programming is starting to catch up, led by acclaimed 2023
premieres like “Poker Face,” “Mrs. Davis” and “Bupkis.” The service also
features a large collection of current and classic Universal titles and
independent films, plus live streaming of everything from Premier League
soccer and the Olympics to the Met Gala. Check back in a couple of years
and it’s entirely possible Peacock will have rocketed up this list.</p>

<p>If you want to understand the problem facing AMC+, you need only pause to
consider the titles missing from the lists above. “Breaking Bad,” “The
Walking Dead” and “Better Call Saul,” three emblems of the network’s
moment atop TV’s recent golden age, are not, as of this writing, available
on the company’s own platform. It’s a hole that dates back to the original
sin of the streaming era — licensing iconic properties to competitors like
Netflix, who became behemoths on the strength of other people’s
programming — and one that AMC Networks continues slowly but surely to dig
itself out of. AMC+ draws on other content streams, most intriguingly
Shudder and IFC Films, in addition to AMC’s current slate of strong
originals (“Interview With the Vampire,” “Lucky Hank”), so it’s not all
bad news. But until Walter White and the walkers join “Mad Men” and “Halt
and Catch Fire” back home where they belong, the streamer will be fighting
with one hand behind its back.</p>

<p>Were this list about preference, not power, this entry might be at, or
near, the top: Who doesn’t want their streaming subscription to support
the survival of public broadcasting? Alas, one glance around the airwaves
would suggest that its admirable mission of strengthening the “social,
democratic, and cultural health of the U.S.” has certain baked-in
limitations on scale, and “powerful” is not the first word most would use
to describe PBS Passport — at least not in the brute sense. Instead, the
platform delivers “Antiques Roadshow”-level bang for your buck, offering
ad-free access to the likes of “American Masters,” “Frontline,”
“Masterpiece,” “NOVA,” “Nature,” “NewsHour,” “Independent Lens” and more,
past and present, for less than the ad-supported price of many of its
larger competitors. Now you never have to miss a new Ken Burns docuseries
again, and you can feel good spending the money to do it.</p>

<p>This stand-alone Spanish-language platform recently dropped the “+” from
its name, but its paid subscription tier will live on without the symbol.
How much weight that tier carries as a proportion of Vix overall is
unclear, though; the company hasn’t announced how many of its 30 million
monthly active users shell out for the service. (In February it reported
25 million on its free tier alone, so you do the math.) What is clear is
the combined power of former rivals Televisa and Univision to create a
global streamer not in English, drawing together programming from the
United States, Mexico, Spain, Colombia, Chile and more and featuring
boldfaced names like Jorge Ramos, Kate del Castillo and Liga MX.</p>

<p>MGM+ (formerly Epix) certainly has its merits, not least of which is a
modicum of access to the MGM vault — think “West Side Story,” “In the Heat
of the Night,” “Jailhouse Rock,” “The Birdcage” and more. But in streaming
as in life, timing is everything, and the combination of its still-
fledgling originals slate and recent rebrand mean the platform is woefully
behind the competition in terms of audience awareness. With the likes of
“Godfather of Harlem” and “Belgravia” under its belt, that might well
change, but it will require scale, buzz or both that MGM+ currently lacks.</p>
