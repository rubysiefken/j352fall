<p>This timeline covers the first three phases of the Marvel film universe. Over 8 years, Marvel released 22 movies, approximately 3 movies each year. This movie franchise has gained more followers than Star Wars, James Bond, and Lord of the Rings and continues to unite families and friends internationally. Seeing these movies in theaters provides a unique cinematic experience that can not be replicated viewing at home, though all of these films can be streamed on Disney+.</p>
<p>The release dates, movie titles, and film cover are all shown for each movie displayed on this timeline. Viewers can watch the series in order, or mix and match movies to catch easter eggs throughout the series.</p>
