<h1>Navient Solutions LLC consumer complaints in Maryland</h1>
<h3>By Ruby Siefken</h3>

<div class="large-8 medium-6 small-12 cell">

<p>Navient Solutions LLC has been accused by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, of failing to act in its customers’ best interests. In response, CFPB filed a lawsuit against the student loan company in January of 2017. A total of 39 state attorneys general have since joined the settlement which requires Navient to cancel $1.7 billion in subprime private student loan balances owed by over 66,000 borrowers and pay $95 million in restitution payments to approximately 350,000 federal student loan borrowers for an estimated $260 each. 
<br><br>
In Maryland, the company’s failures are clear with hundreds of complaints coming in regarding Navient’s shortcomings. Since November 2022, complaints were 53% dealing with lender or servicer concerns, 33% struggling with loan repayment, 10% incorrect report information, and 3% of customers struggling to get a loan in the first place. The high magnitude of lender and servicer concerns suggests that Navient needs to improve their customer service and response team to be more responsive to borrowers about the status, repayment information and report details of their loans.</p>
