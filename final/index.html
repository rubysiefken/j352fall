<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>As the winter months approach in College Park, University of Maryland students scramble to find the perfect place to live for the upcoming school year. Many students base their search on price, others on location or room size. Recent infrastructure in College Park also complicates the search, as new residential apartments have begun popping up surrounding campus, offering new amenities in more convenient locations. 
<br><br>
So, the questions become, which apartment complex is the best choice? This answer differs from one student to another. Off-campus housing services at the University of Maryland has developed a <a href="https://och.umd.edu/global/documents/Off-Campus-Housing-Resource-2023.pdf">checklist</a> for students to most accurately find their future home. Questions include: </p>

      <div class="docs-example-orbit-slide">
        <p><strong>What kind of rental unit do you want to live in?</strong><br><br>The first step to locating the perfect home is determining the number of tenants, bedrooms and bathrooms desired. Some complexes offer shared-rooms and bathrooms while others only offer private rooms and bathrooms, which can limit the selection pool. Additionally, apartment style, in-unit amenities and complex amenities should be considered. </p>

    <li class="orbit-slide">
      <div class="docs-example-orbit-slide">
        <p><strong>What are your transportation needs?</strong><br><br>Each student on campus has a different preferred mode of transportation including walking, bike or e-scooter, public transportation or personal car. Additionally, the student’s major comes into play. STEM majors may benefit from living closer to their buildings along Regents and Technology Dr. while liberal arts students benefit from easy access to McKeldin Mall, where most of their classes are located. </p>

    <li class="orbit-slide">
      <div class="docs-example-orbit-slide">
        <p><strong>What features are essential? </strong><br><br>Apartment complexes offer unique in-unit and building amenities that can attract or deter students from signing leases. A dishwasher, in-unit washer and dryer and air conditioning can make all the difference for students when selecting a room while on-street parking, athletic facilities and handicap accessibility can set different complexes apart. Additionally, students with pets have specific interests that differentiate them. </p>

    <li class="orbit-slide">
      <div class="docs-example-orbit-slide">
        <p><strong>What are your financial means? </strong><br><br>Financial means are arguably the most important aspect of selecting the correct apartment complex and unit. Number or rooms and room furnishing can change prices which is important for students who are on a budget.</p>

      <div class="docs-example-orbit-slide">
        <p><strong>How much legal protection do you require? </strong><br><br>When signing a lease, the University of Maryland recommends maximizing legal protection through appropriate lease agreements and complete awareness about the standards of safety ensured at the complex. </p>

<p>The data above compares the price and distance from McKeldin Library for each apartment complex. These statistics can help students to determine the best choice for their own living situation through an assessment of location and financial reasoning. It is impossible to determine which complex is truly the best, so the decision is now up to the student based on individual needs and resources. </p>
